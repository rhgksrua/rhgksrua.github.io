Javascript [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is a new API to make requests.

## Basic Usage

```
fetch(url, options);
```

`fetch` returns a promise to handle callbacks.

```
// options are optional
fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(json => {
    // Do something with JSON.
  });
```

## Sending credentials (cookies and etc.)

With out an `credentials` property in `options`, fetch will not send any credentials with the request.

```
options = { credentials: 'same-origin' };
```

Passing the above `options` object will include cookies with the request.

This is useful when using session cookies.
